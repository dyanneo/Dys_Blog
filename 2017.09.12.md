Back to work after some time off to care for mom.

What I expected:
- at least one team changed its name to something harder to interpret
- at least one of my PRs was not reviewed or merged

What I didn't expect:
- more people were here than I thought would be (we have a big meeting across town) - that was nice
- our tech lead shared notes and a screenshot of a white board from a team discussion - really awesome

My expectations were met, and I was pleasantly surprised! I'd call that a good start to the week.

I'm doing this to see how I like a blog, and how I like using github for such purposes. I feel a little like a librarian for my team, and was wondering if it would be helpful to others to have a narrative.

Back on my head for now. Looking forward to a presentation I'm giving with a couple other people in October. 

Bye.
